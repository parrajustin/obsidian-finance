## Available Commands

You can run these commands from the Obsidian Command Palette to quickly access
features of the Ledger plugin.

`Add to Ledger`

Open a window to input details for a new transaction. The details will be stored
to your default Ledger file configured in the settings.

`Open Ledger dashboard`

Switch your current window to the Ledger Dashboard. The dashboard will show you
transactions for the default zledger file configured in the settings.
Alternatively, you can also click on any `.ledger` file in the File Explorer to
view that file in the dashboard.

`Reset Ledger Tutorial progress`

Want to see the tutorial again? This will reset your progress so the tutorial
will be shown again the next time you open the dashboard.
